1) Drop Appointments from the getProfile API call
-- just want id, token, first name, last name, phone number (formatted and non-formatted), and picture. 

2) Fix profileValidator -- needs to check to see if at least one field is being updated, for example, id, and then firstName || lastName || photo || phoneNumber. 
If the only field in the req.body is id, then there is no point doing update. 

3) No S3 functionality to fix the user photo update. 

4) submitSalonEmployees -- handle duplicate employees.

5) What happens if a salon has the same phone number as a customer??

6) Remove duplicate days of the week from operating hours.
